## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

    A conditional statement evaluates if something is true or false, and also works as if/then statements, which say if x happens, then y happens.

    If it is rainy, then I will bring a raincoat.

    If my gas tank is empty, then I will get gas.

    If I am thirsty, then I will drink water.

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

    If-statements are helpful especially when you have user input, you need to be able to respond to how the user acts. An if-statement allows a program to respond to a myriad different possible scenarios.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

    if x < a

          code here runs

    end

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

    You can add as many elsif statements as you like for different conditions.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?

    if x == a

      the code here runs

    elsif y == b

      the code here runs

    else z == c

      the code here runs

    end

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?

    Conditional statements evaluate whether something is true or false, so you can use them to check the value of a variable, and there are methods which are conditional, such as the .include? array method, which can tell you if a given element is in the array or not.
