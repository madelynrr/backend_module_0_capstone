## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

    A method is supposed to save time. If you are going to do the same thing to a list of objects, you can write a method that you can call whenever you need to perform that specific function on those objects.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

    def hello

        puts "Sam I am"

    end

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

    def hello_someone(name)

        puts "#{name} I am"

    end


1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

    hello_someone("Madelyn")

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?

    I don't understand the point of the "return" command within a method, if the method is just going to spit out the return value anyway (from the Learn Ruby the Hard Way lesson).

    I think I can write a method out, but I am still a little unclear on the exact vocabulary and what exactly is occurring between the objects, arguments, and local variables.
